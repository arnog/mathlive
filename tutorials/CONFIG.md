These configuration options can be passed to {@linkcode module:MathLive#makeMathField MathLive.makeMathField()}
or {@linkcode module:editor/mathfield#MathField#setConfig MathField.$setConfig()}.

---
**`config.locale`**:`string`

The locale (language + region) to use for string localization.

If not is provided, the locale of the browser is used.


---
**`config.strings`**:`object`

An object whose keys are a locale string, and whose values are an object of 
string identifier to localized string. 

Example:
```
{
   'fr-CA': {
      'tooltip.undo': 'Annuler',
      'tooltip.redo': 'Refaire',
   }
}
```

This will override the default localized strings.


---
**`config.horizontalSpacingScale=1.0`**:`number`

Scaling factor to be
applied to horizontal spacing between elements of the formula. With a value 
greater than 1.0, can be used to improve the legibility.


---
**`config.namespace=''`**:`string`

Namespace that is added to `data-`
attributes to avoid collisions with other libraries. 

It is empty by default.

The namespace should be a string of lowercase letters.


---
**`config.substituteTextArea`**:`function`

A function that returns a focusable element that can be used to capture text input. 

An (invisible) DOM element is used to capture the keyboard events. By default,
this element is a `<textarea>` on desktop and a `<span>` on mobile devices,
to prevent the device virtual keyboard from being displayed.

This function provides the option of substituting the DOM element used for 
keyboard capture

---
**`config.defaultMode`**:`string`

One of `"math"` or `"text"`. Indicate the input mode that the mathfield
will be in when created.

---
**`config.onFocus`**:`function(mathfield:MathField)`

Invoked when the mathfield has
gained focus


---
**`config.onBlur`**:`function(mathfield:MathField)`

Invoked when the mathfield has
lost focus


---
**`config.onKeystroke`**:`function(mathfield:MathField, keystroke:string, ev:Event):boolean`


Invoked when a keystroke is about to be processed. 
- `keystroke`: a string describing the keystroke
- `ev`: the native keyboard event. 

Return `false` to stop the handling of the event.

---
**`config.onAnnounce`**: `function(mathfield:MathField, command: string, before: atoms[], after: atoms[])`

Invoked when a command has modified the selection or content. This is an 
opportunity to provide accessible feedback on navigation and editing operations.

If no function is provided, a default implementation is used which uses an 
`ARIA-live` region to provide descriptive feedback of the editing operations.

---
**`config.overrideDefaultInlineShortcuts=false`**:`boolean`

If `true` the default inline shortcuts (e.g. `p` + `i` = `π`) are ignored.


---
**`config.inlineShortcuts`**:`Object.<string, string>`

A map of shortcuts → replacement value. 

For example `{ 'pi': '\\pi'}`. 
If `overrideDefaultInlineShortcuts` is false, these shortcuts are applied 
after any default ones, and can therefore override them.


---
**`config.inlineShortcutTimeout=0`**:`number`

Maximum time, in milliseconds, 
between consecutive characters for them to be considered part of the same 
shortcut sequence. 

A value of 0 is the same as infinity: any consecutive 
character will be candidate for an inline shortcut, regardless of the 
interval between this character and the previous one. 

A value of 250 will indicate that the maximum interval between two 
characters to be considered part of the same inline shortcut sequence is 
1/4 of a second.

This is useful to enter "+-" as a sequence of two characters, while also 
supporting the "±" shortcut with the same sequence.
The first result can be entered by pausing slightly between the first and 
second character if this option is set to a value of 250 or so.

---
**`config.smartFence=true`**:`boolean`

If `true`, when an open fence is
entered via `typedText()` it will generate a contextually appropriate markup,
for example using `\left...\right` if applicable. 

If `false`, the literal value of the character will be inserted instead.

---
**`config.smartSuperscript=true`**:`boolean`

If `true`, when a digit is entered in an empty superscript, the cursor 
leaps automatically out of the superscript. This makes entry of common
polynomials easier and faster. If entering other characters (for example "n+1")
the navigation out of the superscript must be done manually (by using the cursor
keys or the spacebar to leap to the next insertion point).

If `false`, the navigation out of the superscript must always be done manually.


---
**`config.scriptDepth=Infinity`**:`number`

This controls how many levels of subscript/superscript can be entered.
For example, if `scriptDepth` is "1", there can be one level of superscript or
subscript. Attempting to enter a superscript while inside a superscript will be 
rejected. Setting a value of 0 will prevent entry of any superscript or subscript
(but not limits for sum, integrals, etc...)

This can make it easier to enter equations that fit what's expected for the 
domain where the mathfield is used.

To control the depth of superscript and subscript independently, provide an array:
the first element indicate the maximum depth for subscript and the second element
the depth of superscript. Thus, a value of `[0, 1]` would suppress the entry of 
subscripts, and allow one level of superscripts.

---
**`config.removeExtraneousParentheses=true`**:`boolean`

If `true`, extra parentheses around a numerator or denominator are removed automatically.

---
**`config.ignoreSpacebarInMathMode=true`**:`boolean`

If `true`, when the spacebar is pressed, no space is inserted. 

If `false`, a space is inserted when the spacebar is pressed.


---
**`config.virtualKeyboardToggleGlyph`**:`string`

If specified, the markup 
to be used to display the virtual keyboard toggle glyph. If none is specified
a default keyboard icon is used.


---
**`config.virtualKeyboardMode=''`**:`string`


- `'manual'`: pressing the virtual keyboard toggle button will show or hide
the virtual keyboard. If hidden, the virtual keyboard is not shown when the 
field is focused until the toggle button is pressed.
- `'onfocus'`: the virtual keyboard will be displayed whenever the field is
focused and hidden when the field loses focus. In that case, the virtual 
keyboard toggle button is not displayed.
- `'off'`: the virtual keyboard toggle button is not displayed, and the
virtual keyboard is never triggered.

If the setting is empty, it will default to `'onfocus'` on touch-capable 
devices and to `'off'` otherwise.


---
**`config.virtualKeyboards='all'`**:`string`

A space separated list of
the keyboards that should be available. The keyboard `'all'` is synonym with
`'numeric'`, `'roman'`, `'greek'`, `'functions'` and `'command'`

The keyboards will be displayed in the order indicated.


---
**`config.virtualKeyboardRomanLayout='qwerty'`**:`string`

The
arrangement of the keys for the layers of the roman virtual keyboard.

One of `'qwerty'`, `'azerty'`, `'qwertz'`, `'dvorak'` or `'colemak'`.


---
**`config.customVirtualKeyboardLayers`**:`Object.<string, string>`

Some additional
custom virtual keyboard layers. 

A keyboard is made up of one or more
layers (think of the main layer and the shift layer on a hardware keyboard).
Each key in this object define a new keyboard layer (or replace an existing
one). The value of the key should be some HTML markup.

**See** {@link https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/tree/master/examples/virtual_keyboard virtual keyboard example}


---
**`config.customVirtualKeyboards`**:`object`

An object describing
additional keyboards. 

Each key in the object is an ID for a separate keyboard.

The key should have a value made up of an object with the following keys:
   * `tooltip`: a string label describing the keyboard.
   * `label`: a string, displayed in the keyboard switcher to identify this 
     keyboard
   * `layers`: an array of strings, the ID of the layers used by this keyboard.
    These layers should be defined using `customVirtualKeyboardLayers`.
   * `classes`: a string, the classes to be added to the label for this keyboard
Possible values are 'tex' to use a TeX font to display the label.
   * `layer`: optional, the ID of the layer to switch to when the label of this
keyboard is clicked on in the keyboard switcher.
   * `command`: optional, a selector to perform when the label is clicked.
Either the `command` or `layer` key must be present.

**See** {@link https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/tree/master/examples/virtual_keyboard virtual keyboard example}


---
**`config.virtualKeyboardTheme='apple'`**:`boolean`

The visual theme used
for the virtual keyboard. 

If empty, the theme will switch automatically based on the device it's 
running on. The two supported themes are 'material' and 'apple' (the default).


---
**`config.keypressVibration='true'`**:`boolean`

When a key on the virtual 
keyboard is pressed, produce a short haptic feedback, if the device supports
it.


---
**`config.keypressSound=''`**:`string`

When a key on the virtual 
keyboard is pressed, produce a short audio feedback. 
The value should be either a URL to a sound file or an object with the following keys:
   * `delete` URL to a sound file played when the delete key is pressed
   * `return` ... when the return/tab key is pressed
   * `spacebar` ... when the spacebar is pressed
   * `default` ... when any other key is pressed. This key is required, the
others are optional. If they are missing, this sound is played as well.


---
**`config.plonkSound=''`**:`string`

Path to a URL to a sound file
which will be played to provide feedback when a command has no effect,
for example when pressing the spacebar at the root level.


---
**`config.textToSpeechRules='mathlive'`**:`string`

Specify which
set of text to speech rules to use. 

A value of `mathlive` indicates that the simple rules built into MathLive 
should be used. 

A value of `sre` indicates that the Speech Rule Engine from Volker Sorge 
should be used.

Note that SRE is not included or loaded by MathLive and for this option to
work SRE should be loaded separately.

**See** {@link https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/tree/master/examples/speech speech example}


---
**`config.textToSpeechMarkup=''`**:`string`

The markup syntax to use 
for the output of conversion to spoken text. 

Possible values are `ssml` for the SSML markup or `mac` for the macOS 
markup, i.e. `[[ltr]]`.


---
**`config.textToSpeechRulesOptions={}`**:`object`

A set of key/value pairs
that can be used to configure the speech rule engine. 

Which options are available depends on the speech rule engine in use. 
There are no options available with MathLive's built-in engine. The options 
for the SRE engine are documented
[here]{@link:https://github.com/zorkow/speech-rule-engine}


---
**`config.speechEngine='local'`**:`string`

Indicates which speech engine
to use for speech output. 

Use `local` to use the OS-specific TTS engine.

Use `amazon` for Amazon Text-to-Speech cloud API. You must include the AWS
API library and configure it with your API key before use.

**See** {@link https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/tree/master/examples/speech speech example}


---
**`config.speechEngineVoice=''`**:`string`

Indicates the voice to use with
 the speech engine. 

This is dependent on the speech engine. For Amazon Polly,
see here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html


---
**`config.speechEngineRate=''`**:`string`

Sets the speed of the selected
voice. 

One of `x-slow`, `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, `x-fast` or a value as a percentage.

Range is `20%` to `200%`
For example `200%` to indicate a speaking rate twice the default rate. 



---
**`config.onMoveOutOf`**:`function(mathfield, direction:string):boolean`

A handler
invoked when keyboard navigation would cause the insertion point to leave the
mathfield. 

The argument indicates the direction of the navigation, either 
`"forward"` or `"backward"`. 

Return `false` to prevent the move, `true` to  wrap around to the start of the field.

By default, the insertion point will wrap around.


---
**`config.onTabOutOf`**:`function(mathfield, direction:string)`

A handler invoked when
pressing tab (or shift-tab) would cause the insertion point to leave the mathfield.

The argument indicates the direction of the navigation, either 
`"forward"` or `"backward"`. 

By default, the insertion point jumps to the next/previous focussable element.

A handler
invoked after the virtual keyboard visibility has changed. 

The `visible` argument is true if the virtual keyboard is visible.

The second argument is a DOM
element containing the virtual keyboard, which can be used to determine its
size, and therefore the portion of the screen it obscures.


---
**`config.onReadAloudStatus`**:`function(mathfield, status:string)`

A handler invoked
when the status of read aloud changes. 

The `status` argument is a string denoting the status:
