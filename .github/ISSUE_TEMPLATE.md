> Following the template below will ensure that your issue is addressed as quickly as possible.
> If you don't follow the template, it may be closed without being addressed.

> Include code fragments or CodePen.io links to illustrate the issue. Do not include screenshots of code.
> Simplify the code fragment as much as possible. Remove anything that is not directly related to the issue.
  
>  If you get a runtime or TypeScript error, copy the text of the error message, from the JavaScript console, for example. Do not include a screenshot of the error message.

>  If the issue is with rendering of the math, please include the LaTeX code that is causing the issue as text. Do not include a screenshot of LaTeX code.


>  Screenshots or recording can be useful to illustrate a visual or interactive issue, however also provide a description of the problem in text.

>  Do not include screenshots of code, error messages or LaTeX.


>  If you use React, Vue or some other framework, try to provide some code that replicates the issue using only plain JavaScript. 
>  If you can't, then include a link to a minimal project demonstrating the issue. 
>  This will make it **much** easier to reproduce the issue and fix it.

> If the issue has to do with the Compute Engine or MathJSON, please report it
here: https://github.com/cortex-js/compute-engine/issues

>  If the issue is related to the documentation on cortexjs.io or the behavior of cortexjs.io, please report it here: https://github.com/cortex-js/cortexjs.io/issues

## Description

### Environment

**MathLive version**  _If using the cortexjs.io site, the version is displayed
at the bottom of the page. If using the library, the version is available by
