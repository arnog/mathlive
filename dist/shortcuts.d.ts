 * An inline shortcut can be specified as a simple string or as
 * an object literal with additional options:
 *
 *```javascript
 *     config.inlineShortcuts = {
 *      half: '\\frac{1}{2}',
 *      in: {
 *          mode: 'math',
 *          after: 'space+letter+digit+symbol+fence',
 *          value: '\\in',
 *      },
 *  };
 *```
 *
 * When using a string, the shortcut will apply in any mode, and regardless
 * of the characters surrounding it.
 *
 * When using an object literal the `value` key is required an indicate the
 * shortcut substitution.
 *
 * The `mode` key, if present, indicate which mode this shortcut will
 * apply in, either `'math'` or `'text'`. If the key is not present the
 * shortcut apply in all modes.
 *
 * The `'after'` key, if present, indicate in what context (surrounding characters)
 * the shortcut will apply. One or more values can be specified, separated by a '+'
 * sign. If any of the values match, the shortcut will be applicable.
