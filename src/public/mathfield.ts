| Format                | Description             |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `"ascii-math"`        | A string of [ASCIIMath](http://asciimath.org/). |
| `"latex"`             | LaTeX rendering of the content, with LaTeX macros not expanded. |
| `"latex-expanded"`    | All macros are recursively expanded to their definition. |
| `"latex-unstyled"`    | Styling (background color, color) is ignored |
| `"math-json"`         | A MathJSON abstract syntax tree, as an object literal formated as a JSON string. Note: you must import the CortexJS Compute Engine to obtain a result. |
| `"math-ml"`           | A string of MathML markup. |
| `"spoken"`            | Spoken text rendering, using the default format defined in config, which could be either text or SSML markup. |
| `"spoken-text"`       | A plain spoken text rendering of the content. |
| `"spoken-ssml"`       | A SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) version of the content, which can be used with some text-to-speech engines such as AWS. |
| `"spoken-ssml-with-highlighting"`| Like `"spoken-ssml"` but with additional annotations necessary for synchronized highlighting (read aloud). |

   * To use the`"math-json"` format the Compute Engine library must be loaded. Use for example:
   * ```js
import "https://unpkg.com/@cortex-js/compute-engine?module";
```
