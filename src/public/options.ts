export type Keybinding = {
  /**
   * The pressed keys that will trigger this keybinding.
   *
   * The `key` is made up of modifiers and the key itself.
   *
   * The following modifiers can be used:
   *
   *  | Platform | Modifiers |
   *  | :----- | :----- |
   *  | macOS, iOS |  `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `cmd` |
   *  | Windows |  `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `win` |
   *  | Linux, Android, ChromeOS |  `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `meta` |
   *
   * If the `cmd` modifier is used, the keybinding will only apply on macOS.
   * If the `win` modifier is used, the keybinding will only apply to Windows.
   * If the `meta` modifier is used, the keybinding will apply to platforms
   * other than macOS or Windows.
   *
   * The `alt` key is the `option` key on Apple keyboards.
   *
   *
   * The following values for keys can be used:
   * * `a`&ndash;`z`, `0`&ndash;`9`
   * * `` ` ``, `-`, `=`, `[`, `]`, `\`, `;`, `'`, `,`, `.`, `/`
   * * `left`, `up`, `right`, `down`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `end`, `home`
   * * `tab`, `enter`, `escape`, `space`, `backspace`, `delete`
   * * `f1`&ndash;`f19`
   * * `pausebreak`, `capslock`, `insert`
   * * `numpad0`&ndash;`numpad9`, `numpad_multiply`, `numpad_add`, `numpad_separator`
   * * `numpad_subtract`, `numpad_decimal`, `numpad_divide`
   *
   * The values will be remapped based on the current keyboard layout. So, for
   * example if `a` is used, on a French AZERTY keyboard the keybinding will be
   * associated with the key labeled 'A' (event though it corresponds to the
   * key labeled 'Q' on a US QWERTY keyboard).
   *
   * To associate keybindings with physical keys independent of the keyboard
   * layout, use the following keycodes:
   *
   * - `[KeyA]`&ndash;`[KeyZ]`, `[Digit0]`&ndash;`[Digit9]`
   * - `[Backquote]`, `[Minus]`, `[Equal]`, `[BracketLeft]`, `[BracketRight]`, `[Backslash]`, `[Semicolon]`, `[Quote]`, `[Comma]`, `[Period]`, `[Slash]`
   * - `[ArrowLeft]`, `[ArrowUp]`, `[ArrowRight]`, `[ArrowDown]`, `[PageUp]`, `[PageDown]`, `[End]`, `[Home]`
   * - `[Tab]`, `[Enter]`, `[Escape]`, `[Space]`, `[Backspace]`, `[Delete]`
   * - `[F1]`&ndash;`[F19]`
   * - `[Pause]`, `[CapsLock]`, `[Insert]`
   * - `[Numpad0]`&ndash;`[Numpad9]`, `[NumpadMultiply]`, `[NumpadAdd]`, `[NumpadComma]`
   * - `[NumpadSubtract]`, `[NumpadDecimal]`, `[NumpadDivide]`
   *
   * For example, using `[KeyQ]` will map to the the key labeled 'Q' on a QWERTY
   * keyboard, and to the key labeled 'A' on an AZERTY keyboard.
   *
   * As a general guideline, it is preferable to use the key values `a`&ndash;`z`
   * for keybinding that are pseudo-mnemotechnic. For the other, it is generally
   * preferable to use the keycodes.
   *
   * Consider the key combination: `alt+2`. With an AZERTY (French) layout,
   * the digits (i.e. '2') are only accessible when shifted. The '2' key produces
   * 'Ã©' when not shifted. It is therefore impossible on an AZERTY keyboard to
   * produce the `alt+2` key combination, at best it would be `alt+shift+2`.
   * To indicate that the intended key combination should be `alt` and the
   * key on the keyboard which has the position of the `2` key on a US keyboard,
   * a key code should be used instead: `alt+[Digit2]`. This will correspond
   * to a key combination that can be generated on any keyboard.
